
*** Setting up the project ***
    Firstly, users need to create a java project, then create a package named "MatchingUnderConstraints", and finally, put all the source codes in that package.
	
	
*** All source programs are in the package "MatchingUnderConstraints"



*** Testing the 3 instances from Task 4 in different algorithm ***
    
    Users can use the methods instance1Matching(), instance2Matching(int numberOfStudents), instance3Matching(int numberOfStudents)
from each class TaskX.java (Task 4, 6, 8 and 10) in order to test instance 1, 2 and 3 respectively according to conditions demanded in
each task.

Remark: For each test task that uses the algorithm from Task 2, the maximum quota for each group in each school is set to be equal to
	the total number of students of that group.
